# Forecast Missouri Land_Value
This repo  documents my code to forecast Missouri land value

1. Find data source with average land values by zip/county over time.
2. Compute changes over time: YoY, by decade, and aggregate from beginning to now.
3. Investigate potential features explaining noticeable differences.
4. Do inferential statisics on features found and determine correlation to land value.
